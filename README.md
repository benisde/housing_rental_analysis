Please Note:- After loading the python file into Git Hub the preview was not showing the graphs or maps. Hence, took a picture of the output graph or map when it was run in the Jupyter Lab and then included the image of it as a seperate line in markdown language. Images of these outputs are uploaded in the Image folder. These output impage files can be distinguished as "_Beni" at the end in the name of the file.
